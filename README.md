# Meditation Timer

## Description
This app lets you enter the amount of time you'd like to meditate, then a clock counts down from the input time to 00:00:00.
While the clock is counting down, you can pause the time and resume it, stop the time (and go back to the input) or restart the clock.

### TODO

Play a sound and show a message when the timer gets to 00:00:00.
